            <p style = "text-align: center; color: white">Hi! My name is
              Ethan Lewis and am currently a student at Claremont Mckenna
            College. I am majoring in computer science through Harvey Mudd Colleges'
              off campus program. <br> I was born and raised in Honolulu Hawaii where I grew
              up hiking, eating mass quantities of poke, and most likely preforming every
              water sport you could think of. </br> <br>I was lucky enough to attend
              Punahou High School where my interest for CS developed. I took the AP
                Comptuer Science course offered there and fell in love with the problem
              solving,  creativity, and satisfaction aspects of CS. </br> <br> I would describe
              myself as someone who is high functioning and will get things done. I can adapt
            and learn on the fly and usually will enjoy doing so. This can be shown acedemically
            with this website and teaching myself the basics of website developement and similarly
            in my atheletic career where being the captain of two varisty teams ("waterpolo, canoe
            paddling")  I led us to two state championships. </br> <br> If you are an employer  and
          would like to contact me, my resume and LinkedIn can be found bellow!</br></p>

              and Java Script while also giving people a more personal way of getting to know me.
